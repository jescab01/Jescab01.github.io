# Modeling the role of thalamus in rsFC (Figures)


## Results

**Fig 5.** Thalamocortical experiment. Results of simulating the four thalamocortical scenarios for ten subjects. 
Central column showing averaged FC and dFC metrics for three different SC versions. Shadowed the pre-bifurcation 
range defining the intervals for scenarios 1 (active) and 3 (transthalamic low-power). Note that in active scenario 
all multiple comparisons between SC versions are statistically significant. Central row showing a bifurcation diagrams 
for cortex (thick line) and thalamus (dashed line) with maximum and minimum voltage per coupling factor. In the margins,
boxplots for maximum values of rPLV and minimum KSD per subject and thalamic structure.

**Fig 6.** Cortico-cerebellar network simulations. Boxplot showing maximum rPLV values per subject in the pre-bifurcation 
space both for thalamus and cerebellum experiments. Right, lineplots conveying averaged parameter spaces per condition.
Shadowed area represents defined pre-bifurcation space.

**Fig 7.** Simulation samples for one subject with parceled thalamus. Columns showing simulated scenarios with g=4 for 
prebifurcation scenarios (i.e. active 1 and trans-low 3), and with g=36 for postbifurcation scenarios 
(i.e. relay 2 and trans-high 4). Rows showing demeaned signals, spectra, PLV and dFC matrices, respectively.

**Fig 8.** Parameter space explorations for $$p_{th}$$ in active and relay scenarios. Sets of three simulations averaged 
for subject one and parcelled thalamus. In columns showing several metrics that chcaracterize each simulation in the parameter space.

**Fig 9.** Parameter space explorations for $$\eta_{th}$$ in active and relay scenarios. Sets of three simulations averaged 
for one subject and parcellated thalamus. In columns showing several metrics that chcaracterize each simulation in the parameter space. 
Vertical dashed lines defining the optimal SNR range.

**Fig 10.** Complementary active scenarios. Subset of scenarios derived from the parameter explorations that show 
additional situations in which thalamus drives the cortical activity. Simulations for one subject, 
g = 2 and parcellated thalamus. Rows showing demeaned signals, spectra, PLV and dFC matrices, respectively.

**Fig 11.** Distributions of Pearson's correlations in dFC matrices for empirical and simulated data of subject one. 
Simulations were performed for active scenario 1 (g = 3, 7) and relay scenario 2 (g = 9, 40) with noisy 
inputs to thalamus ($$\eta_{th}$$ = 0.022).

**Fig 12.** Lineplots showing $$r_{PLV}$$, KSD and bifurcations per subject and SC version. The global behaviour 
in $$r_{PLV}$$ (first column) was similar for every subject. Note slight differences for subject 2 and subject 8 in 
which the bifurcation does not match the highest $$r_{PLV}$$ value.

**Fig 13.** Rising cortical noise hampers rPLV. First row, showing simulations where all nodes have the same 
parametrization (p=0.09; $$\eta$$=variable). Second row, showing simulations with a thalamus in limit cycle condition 
($$p_{th}$$=0.15, $$\eta_{th}$$=0.09) and a variable noisy input to cortical nodes ($$p_{cx}$$=0.09, 
$$\eta_{cx}$$=variable). Note that adding independent noise to cortical nodes is not enhancing $$r_{PLV}$$ values, 
but on the contrary, it hampers FC.
