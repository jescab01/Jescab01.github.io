In Alzheimer's disease (AD) there are two classical histopathological findings:
the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (AB) into plaques and the abnormal accumulation of 
hyperphosphorilated-tau (hp-tau) into neurofibrilary tangles. These accumulations affect neural 
tissue in different ways: AB tends to generate neuronal hyperexcitation while hp-tau tends to 
generate neural silencing. 

At a macroscopic level, during AD development there have been reported changes 
in the brain synchrony: 1) posterior hyper-synchrony at early stages; 
2) anterior hypersynchrony and posterior hyposynchrony at MCI; and 3) global hyposynchrony at diagnosed AD.

It is not completely understood how those levels of analysis are connected toguether. Therefore, 
we make use computational brain models to try to connect in silico those empirical observations.
