    Thalamus is a nut size structure in the centre of the brain. It gates information flowing 
    from the peripheral nervous system to the cortex and establishes cortico-cortical pathways
    for higher order information exchange. By connecting to multiple brain regions it is involved in: 
    sleep, attention, memory, motor and sensory processing, and consciousness.

    From a classical perspective, thalamus has been regarded as a passive relay node. 
    However, some studies propose that it may also have an active role in shaping brain dynamics and cognition. 
    Therefore, we used in-silico brain models explore the role of thalamus in shaping functional connectivity.

    We use current propagation models and brain network models to understand how transcraneal alternating current
    stimulation (tACS) affects brain synchrony. We also asses theoretically to what extent neural mass models 
    and spiking neural networks can help us understanding this issue.

    In Alzheimer's disease (AD) there are two classical histopathological findings:
    the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (AB) into plaques and the abnormal accumulation of 
    hyperphosphorilated-tau (hp-tau) into neurofibrilary tangles. These accumulations affect neural 
    tissue in different ways: AB tends to generate neuronal hyperexcitation while hp-tau tends to 
    generate neural silencing. 

    At a macroscopic level, during AD development there have been reported changes 
    in the brain synchrony: 1) posterior hyper-synchrony at early stages; 
    2) anterior hypersynchrony and posterior hyposynchrony at MCI; and 3) global hyposynchrony at diagnosed AD.

    It is not completely understood how those levels of analysis are connected toguether. Therefore, 
    we make use computational brain models to try to connect in silico those empirical observations.
