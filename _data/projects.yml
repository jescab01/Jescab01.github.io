    Thalamus is a nut size structure in the centre of the brain. It is a gate of information flowing 
    from the periferal nervous system to the cortex and it connects to mulpitle regions in the brain.
    It participates in a wide variety of cognitive functions: 
    sensory processing, movement, consciousness, attention, and memory, among others.
    
    Sometimes subcortical regions are disregarded in brain simulations and therefore, we wondered: 
    **What is the role of thalamus in brain simulations?**

    In Alzheimer's disease (AD) there are two classical histopathological findings:
    the abnormal ccumulation of amyloid-beta (AB) into plaques and the abnormal accumulation of 
    hyperphosphorilated-tau (hp-tau) into neurofibrilary tangles. These accumulations affect neural 
    tissue in different ways: AB tends to generate neuronal hyperexcitation while hp-tau tends to 
    generate neural silencing. 
    
    At a macroscopic level, during AD development there have been reported changes 
    in the brain synchrony: 1) posterior hypersynchrony at early stages; 
    2) anterior hypersynchrony and posterior hyposynchrony at MCI; and 3) global hyposynchrony at diagnosed AD.

    It is not completely understood how those levels of analysis are connected toguether. Therefore, 
    we make use computational brain models to try to connect in silico those empirical observations.

    We use current propagation models and brain network models to understand how transcraneal alternating current
    stimulation (tACS) affects brain synchrony. We also asses theoretically to what extent neural mass models 
    and spiking neural networks can help us understanding this issue.
